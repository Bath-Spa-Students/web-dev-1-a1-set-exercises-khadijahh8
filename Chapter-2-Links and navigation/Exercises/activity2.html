     • I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see<b> Tangled,</b> after the disappointment that was Princess <br>
     and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe  <br>
     to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick I'm rather wary of today's animation <br>
     features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.

    • I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there were slapstick and broad humor sure to make little kiddos laugh. But <br>
     I was surprised by the sophistication as well. The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well <br>
     done;adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious. The hero and <br>
     heroine are very likable and not flat.And there's a sense of sadness/wistfulness throughout the whole show that <br>
     the adults will understand.</p>
